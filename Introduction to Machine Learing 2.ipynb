    "## Ans. Underfitting occurs in machine learning when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns or relationships present in the data. The model fails to learn from the training data effectively, resulting in poor performance not only on the training data but also on new, unseen data. Underfitting can happen in various scenarios, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.Insufficient Model Complexity: If the model used is too basic or lacks the necessary complexity to capture the complexity of the data, it may underfit. For example, using a linear regression model to fit a highly nonlinear relationship in the data may lead to underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.Limited Features: When important features are not included or represented inadequately in the dataset, the model may struggle to capture the underlying patterns. For instance, using only a single feature to predict a target variable that depends on multiple factors may lead to underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.Small Training Dataset: Insufficient training data can limit the model's ability to generalize. With a small dataset, the model may fail to capture the full range of variations and generalize well to new examples, resulting in underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.Over-regularization: While regularization techniques can help prevent overfitting, applying excessive regularization can push the model towards underfitting. If the regularization term is too dominant, the model might become too simplified and fail to capture important patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.Incorrect Algorithm or Hyperparameter Choices: Choosing an inappropriate algorithm or setting hyperparameters poorly can contribute to underfitting. For example, using a linear algorithm for a problem that requires nonlinear relationships may lead to underfitting.\n",

A high bias model has limited capacity to capture complex patterns in the data, resulting in underfitting.

    "## Common regularization techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "## L1 and L2 Regularization (also known as Lasso and Ridge): These methods add a penalty term to the loss function during training.

L2 regularization, on the other hand, encourages small weights and helps prevent large weight values.\n",
